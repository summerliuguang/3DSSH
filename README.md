## Features

- **Full ANSI / VT100 terminal** — tmux status bar, claude-code spinner,
  box-drawing borders, 256-color, TrueColor, Braille; everything renders.
- **Chinese rendering** — bundled Zpix 12px pixel font covers 21,000+ CJK
  unified ideographs, Terminus 6×12 for ASCII; mixed CJK/ASCII baselines
  align cleanly on the same line.
- **Self-drawn soft keyboard** — iOS-style 3px rounded keys with smooth
  press-down animation; letters / symbols pages.
- **Pinyin input method** — top 300k entries from rime-ice, plus
  abbreviation matching (`nh` → 你好), prefix fallback (`nihaoz`
  auto-falls-back to `nihao`), and a candidate cursor.
- **Voice input (v1.0)** — press **START**, speak a Chinese sentence,
  press **START** again; ~1-2 s later the transcribed text drops
  straight into the SSH terminal.  Default backend is OpenRouter
  Whisper Large V3 Turbo over the cloud (`$0.04` per audio-hour); a
  self-hosted whisper.cpp track is available if you'd rather not depend
  on an external API.
- **Voice AI ask (NEW in v1.1)** — hold **L** and press **START** to
  ask DeepSeek-Chat a question by voice; the answer pops up in a
  bottom-screen modal with markdown-styled rendering (headers in
  yellow, code in cyan, bullets, etc.) without disturbing the SSH
  session above.  Press **A** in the modal to keep history for follow-
  up questions, **B** to clear and start a new conversation.
- **On-device multi-server settings (v1.2)** — a **SET** button pinned
  to the keyboard's bottom-right opens a settings page: up to 4
  servers, HOST/PORT/USER editing, **password login** or RSA pubkey,
  voice API URL, SAVE back to the SD card and one-tap RECONNECT.  No
  more hand-crafting config.ini.
- **SSH windows (v1.3)** — a **WIN** button next to SET cycles through
  the configured servers.  Background windows stay **online** (tmux and
  vim keep running), switching is instant and independent.  Each window
  owns a terminal (~0.6 MB incl. 500-line scrollback); four windows add
  ~2.5 MB total — negligible on a 64 MB 3DS.
- **HTTP voice API (v1.2)** — START recordings can go straight to a
  LAN speech-to-text server (e.g. mimo-voice-hub's `/api/stt`); the
  transcribed text lands in the terminal.  L+START AI ask still uses
  the SSH shim.
- **RSA-4096 public-key auth** — libssh2 + mbedTLS, private key read
  from the SD card.
- **Native Tailscale transport** — optionally join the 3DS to a tailnet and
  carry SSH over direct UDP, Tailscale Peer Relay, or DERP without running Go
  or `tailscaled`.
- **Full physical-key mapping** — D-pad arrow keys, hold-style modifiers
  (L = Shift, Y = Ctrl, X = Alt), Circle Pad scrollback / mouse-wheel.
- **Anthropic-red crab mascot** — scampers along the bottom row, dodges
  when you tap it 🦀.
- **Hidden debug page** — double-tap the ENG/CHN badge to see the live
  SSH byte stream, full key-binding cheat sheet, and a mascot toggle.

## Install

DSSH runs on a **modded 3DS / 2DS / New 3DS**.  You need either the
Homebrew Launcher (HBL) or a CIA installer like FBI.

### Option A — `.cia` install (recommended)

1. Grab `DSSH.cia` (~14 MB) from the [latest release](../../releases/latest).
2. Copy it anywhere on the SD card (e.g. `/cias/DSSH.cia`).
3. Open FBI → SD → select `DSSH.cia` → `Install CIA`.
4. The orange DSSH icon shows up on the HOME menu.

### Option B — `.3dsx` direct launch

1. Grab `3dssh.3dsx` from the latest release.
2. Copy to `/3ds/dssh/dssh.3dsx` on the SD card.
3. Open HBL → pick DSSH.

### Option C — `3dslink` over Wi-Fi (developer flow)

```bash
# On the 3DS: launch HBL, press Y → "Waiting for 3dslink..."
3dslink -a <3DS-LAN-IP> 3dssh.3dsx
```

---

## Server-side setup (one-time)

The 3DS libssh2 build uses mbedTLS as its crypto backend and
**hardcodes-disables ed25519**.  So you generate a fresh RSA-4096
keypair just for the 3DS — your existing ed25519 key on the PC keeps
working untouched.

> ⚠️ **The `-m PEM` flag matters.**  devkitPro's `3ds-mbedtls`
> package is pinned at 2.28.x, which can only parse the **traditional
> PEM** private-key format (`-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`).  Recent
> `ssh-keygen` (Ubuntu 18.04+, macOS) defaults to the **new OpenSSH
> format** (`-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`) which mbedtls 2.28
> *cannot* read — DSSH will fail at handshake with "auth failed" if
> you skip `-m PEM`.

```bash
# 1. Generate a 3DS-only RSA key on your PC.  -m PEM forces the
#    traditional PEM format so the on-3DS mbedtls can parse it.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_3ds -C "3ds-ssh-client"

# 2. Copy the public half into the server's authorized_keys
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_3ds.pub user@your-server.example.com

# 3. Verify the new RSA key works from your PC
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_3ds user@your-server.example.com 'echo OK'
```

**Already have an OpenSSH-format key?**  Convert it in place — no
need to re-add it to the server (the public half is unchanged):

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_3ds
# enter old passphrase (empty if none) and accept any new passphrase.
# The file's first line should now read: -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

You can sanity-check the format with `head -1 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_3ds`.

**Recommended hardening**: prepend the new line in the server's
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` with `from="<your-home-public-IP>"` so a lost
SD card can only log in from your home network.

Copy the **private key** `~/.ssh/id_rsa_3ds` onto the SD card at
`/3ds/3dssh/id_rsa` (the path is fixed even when DSSH is installed as a
.cia — config + key always read from `sdmc:/3ds/3dssh/`).

> ⚠️ The SD card stores the key in plain text.  Anyone holding the SD
> can log in to your server.  Add `from="..."` IP restriction or
> `command="..."` lockdown in `authorized_keys`.

---

## Configure config.ini

**Since v1.2 you can configure everything on the 3DS itself**: tap the
**SET** button pinned to the bottom-right of the keyboard to open the
settings page (up to 4 servers, `< SRV n/4 >` selector — browsing to a
configured slot also selects it; tap a row to edit, **A** commit /
**B** backspace / **SELECT** cancel), then **SAVE** writes the file back
to the SD card and **RECONNECT** re-dials immediately.

Hand-editing still works — copy `sd_template/3ds/3dssh/config.ini.example`
to the SD card at `/3ds/3dssh/config.ini` and edit the values:

```ini
# Servers 1..4; server1 uses RSA pubkey, server2 uses a password
server1_host = your-server.example.com
server1_port = 22
server1_user = ubuntu
server1_auth = key
server1_key_path = sdmc:/3ds/3dssh/id_rsa
server1_passphrase =

server2_host = 192.0.2.10
server2_port = 22
server2_user = root
server2_auth = password
server2_password = change-me

# Which server to connect to at boot (1-based)
active_server = 1

# Optional: HTTP voice-transcription endpoint — see "Voice input"
voice_api_url =

# Optional: unlock the current SSH user's macOS login keychain
macos_keychain_password =

# Optional: connect SSH through the tailnet
tailscale_auth_key =
tailscale_hostname = dssh-3ds
tailscale_state = sdmc:/3ds/3dssh/tailscale.state
tailscale_control_url = https://controlplane.tailscale.com
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `serverN_host` / `serverN_port` / `serverN_user` | Address, port (default 22), and login user of server N |
| `serverN_auth` | `key` (default, RSA pubkey) or `password` |
| `serverN_key_path` / `serverN_passphrase` | Private key path and passphrase; `sdmc:/...` is the 3DS standard SD prefix |
| `serverN_password` | Login password for password auth (stored in plaintext on the SD card — mind physical security) |
| `active_server` | Server index to connect to at boot (1-based) |
| `voice_api_url` | HTTP speech-to-text endpoint; empty = classic SSH-shim transport |
| `macos_keychain_password` | Optional macOS login password; setting it enables automatic unlock for the current SSH user |
| `tailscale_auth_key` | Auth key used for registration; setting it enables Tailscale automatically |
| `tailscale_hostname` | Device name shown in the tailnet |
| `tailscale_state` | Persistent machine/WireGuard/DISCO identity file |
| `tailscale_control_url` | Coordination server; defaults to Tailscale SaaS |

> The legacy flat keys (`host =` / `port =` / `user =` / `key_path =` /
> `passphrase =`) are still accepted and map to server 1.

When `macos_keychain_password` is set, DSSH waits for the current interactive PTY
shell to finish initialization, then runs
`/usr/bin/security unlock-keychain "$HOME/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db"`.
It waits until macOS prints `password to unlock` before sending the password
through the PTY—not `-p`, the remote process arguments, or shell history. This
matches macOS Keychain's interactive-session requirement and works with fish,
zsh, and bash. DSSH then clears its in-memory copy. If unlock fails, the normal
SSH shell remains available and a warning is shown. A later `claude` launch can
then read the credential already stored in that login keychain.

Successful unlock diagnostics are hidden and the bootstrap output is cleared
before fish redraws its prompt. On failure, DSSH keeps one concise warning with
the unlock and verification status codes. The password itself is never shown.

Quote a password containing `#` or leading/trailing spaces:

```ini
macos_keychain_password = "my # password"
```

> ⚠️ This option stores your **macOS login password in plaintext on the
> removable SD card**. That is more sensitive than a dedicated SSH key. Use a
> dedicated macOS account where practical, keep the SD card physically secure,
> and leave this field empty unless you accept this risk.

### Native Tailscale transport

Tailscale support is provided by
[`cadl/libts3ds`](https://github.com/cadl/libts3ds), an experimental native C
client for Nintendo 3DS derived from MicroLink. It is not the official Go
`tailscale/libtailscale` library and does not run `tailscaled`. DSSH pins the
audited source as the `libts3ds` git submodule at the
[`libts3ds-v0.1.0`](https://github.com/cadl/libts3ds/releases/tag/libts3ds-v0.1.0)
release. The top-level `make` builds the static library automatically.

When enabled, SSH uses the private libts3ds/lwIP TCP stack and can select
direct UDP, Tailscale Peer Relay, or DERP. The default build uses automatic
path selection. Diagnostic builds can fix the data path at compile time with
`DSSH_TAILSCALE_PATH=direct`, `peer-relay`, or `derp`.

Tailscale also starts automatically without an auth key when the state file
exists. `tailscale_hostname` defaults to `dssh-3ds`, and `tailscale_state`
defaults to `sdmc:/3ds/3dssh/tailscale.state`. The auth key may remain in the
configuration after registration, although removing it reduces exposure if the
SD card is lost.

The state file contains private machine, WireGuard, and DISCO identity keys.
Treat both it and the auth key as secrets. This is an unofficial community
integration and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Tailscale Inc.


Final SD layout:

```
sdmc:/3ds/3dssh/
├── config.ini
├── id_rsa
└── tailscale.state            # created after Tailscale registration
```

## Voice input

> **TL;DR**: install the **API track** (one curl + one API key, ~30 KB
> on disk, ~1-2 s end-to-end).  The self-hosted track exists for
> completeness but is *not recommended* for typical servers — see the
> warning at the bottom of this section.

Press **START** on the 3DS, speak a Chinese sentence, press **START**
again — the transcribed UTF-8 text drops into the SSH terminal as if
you had typed it.  Full sentences flow into Claude Code without ever
opening the soft keyboard.

The 3DS records 16 kHz PCM mono via its built-in microphone, ships up
to 8 seconds of audio over a **second libssh2 channel** on the same
SSH session (no new ports, no new auth, no firewall changes), and a
small server-side shim transcribes via Whisper.

**Status indicator** (top-left of the soft keyboard top row):
- 🔴 **REC** (red, pulsing) — recording in progress
- ⠋⠙⠹⠸ (cyan, spinning) — uploading + transcribing
- **ERR** (red, 2 s) — request failed; press START again to retry

### HTTP API track (v1.2, self-hosted transcription server)

Instead of the SSH shim, DSSH can POST the START recording directly to
any HTTP speech-to-text endpoint.  The request body is a 16 kHz PCM16
mono WAV; the JSON response's `text` field is the transcription.
Configure it in SETTINGS or config.ini:

```ini
voice_api_url = https://192.0.2.10:29006/api/stt
```

- Transcribed text is typed into the terminal with the same typewriter
  effect — effectively "voice into the input box"
- Self-signed https certificates are accepted on the 3DS side
  (`SSLCOPT_DisableVerify`); http works too.  The upload runs on a
  worker thread so the UI never stalls
- **L+START AI ask does not use this track** — it still needs the SSH
  shim (only the shim knows DeepSeek)
- Takes effect immediately after SETTINGS SAVE; the debug page shows
  `VOICE: HTTP API / SSH shim`
- Bake a LAN endpoint in as the compiled default (kept out of the
  repo): `make DSSH_VOICE_API_DEFAULT=https://server:29006/api/stt`
- Reference server: mimo-voice-hub's `/api/stt` (Xiaomi MiMo ASR), with
  a browser quick page at `/stt` that drives the same endpoint

### Recommended install — API track (SSH shim)

The voice features need **two API keys** on the server.  Both
together cost a few cents per month for personal use:

| Key | Where to get it | What it powers | Required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenRouter** | [openrouter.ai/settings/keys](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) | Whisper Large V3 Turbo (speech → text) | **Required** for voice IME (START) and AI ask (L+START) |
| **DeepSeek** | [platform.deepseek.com/api_keys](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) | DeepSeek-Chat (AI question answering) | Optional — only needed for L+START AI ask; voice IME works without it |

Pricing: OpenRouter Whisper Turbo is `$0.04 / audio-hour` (~a few
cents per month for an individual); DeepSeek-Chat is roughly
`$0.0001 per question`.  Both providers give a small free credit on
sign-up, more than enough to test.

#### One-command install

SSH into your server, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fishason/DSSH.git ~/dssh-repo
bash ~/dssh-repo/tools/install_whisper_api.sh
```

The installer will interactively prompt for both keys:

```
▶ checking prerequisites...
✓ python3 3.10
▶ installing daemon + shim + dssh-whisper CLI ...
▶ writing track config...

Need your OpenRouter API key (https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys).
Used for Whisper transcription.  Looks like:  sk-or-v1-...
Paste your OpenRouter key (or empty to skip): █

✓ api-key saved at /home/you/.config/dssh-whisper/api-key (chmod 0600)

Optional: DeepSeek API key (https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys).
Used only by the L+START voice AI-ask modal — skip if you only
want plain voice IME.  Looks like:  sk-...
Paste your DeepSeek key (or empty to skip): █

✓ deepseek-key saved at /home/you/.config/dssh-whisper/deepseek-key (chmod 0600)
✓ dssh-whisper-api installed (lightweight, OpenRouter Whisper Turbo).
```

**Non-interactive** install (handy for CI / Ansible / clean rebuilds):

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-..." \
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="sk-..." \
bash ~/dssh-repo/tools/install_whisper_api.sh
```

#### Verify the install worked

```bash
$ dssh-whisper status
active track: api
(API-only install — no local daemon)
api-key:  ✓ /home/you/.config/dssh-whisper/api-key
```

The 3DS calls `~/.local/bin/dssh-whisper-shim` over SSH-exec on every
**START** press; no further server-side action is needed.

#### What the installer dropped on disk

```
~/.config/dssh-whisper/
├── track            # "api" or "local"
├── api-key          # chmod 0600 — OpenRouter
└── deepseek-key     # chmod 0600 — DeepSeek (optional)
~/.local/bin/
├── dssh-whisper          # CLI wrapper (start/stop/status/switch/uninstall)
└── dssh-whisper-shim     # symlink the 3DS reaches over SSH-exec
~/.local/share/dssh-whisper/
└── whisper_shim.py       # the actual Python that talks to both APIs
```

Footprint: ~30 KB.  No daemon, no model, nothing to monitor.

#### Rotating a key later

Compromised key, expired credit, swapping providers — overwrite the
file:

```bash
echo 'sk-or-v1-NEW_KEY' > ~/.config/dssh-whisper/api-key
chmod 0600 ~/.config/dssh-whisper/api-key
# (no service to restart — the shim re-reads the key on every call)
```

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Inference | OpenRouter Whisper Large V3 Turbo (cloud) + DeepSeek-Chat |
| Latency (4 s clip) | ~1-2 s STT, +1-2 s LLM for AI ask |
| Cost | $0.04 / audio-hour STT + ~$0.0001 / AI question |
| Server install size | ~30 KB |
| Server CPU load | negligible |
| Internet | required (HTTPS to openrouter.ai + api.deepseek.com) |

That's enough for 99% of users — install it, press START, done.

### `dssh-whisper` CLI

```
dssh-whisper status                # active track + daemon status + key presence
dssh-whisper switch                # toggle api ↔ local
dssh-whisper switch [api|local]    # set explicit track
dssh-whisper start                 # start local daemon (dual install only)
dssh-whisper stop | close          # stop local daemon
dssh-whisper restart
dssh-whisper logs [-f]             # tail systemd-user logs (dual install)
dssh-whisper uninstall             # remove all dssh-whisper files
```

Daemon-related commands degrade gracefully on the API-only install
(they print "no daemon to start", non-fatal).

### Quick AI questions (L + START) — v1.1

Stuck in `yazi` and forgot the keybind for hidden files?  Need a
one-liner regex for `vim`?  Hold **L** and press **START** — you're
now asking the AI instead of typing into the SSH session.  A modal
pops up on the bottom screen with the answer; the SSH terminal on top
is left untouched.

| In modal | Effect |
|---|---|
| **A** | close, **keep** the Q&A in history; next L+START continues the conversation |
| **B** or any **touch** on the bottom screen | close, **clear** history; next L+START is fresh |

Conversation history caps at 5 turns; if you keep pressing A past
that, the oldest turn drops off (FIFO).

The model is `deepseek-chat` (DeepSeek direct API, not via
OpenRouter) — picked for its sub-second latency and very low pricing
(~$0.0001 per question for personal use).  Answers are 6-15 sentences
typically; long answers wrap inside the modal and overflow truncates
with a trailing `...`.

#### Markdown rendering in the modal

DeepSeek tends to use markdown.  The modal renders common forms in
colour rather than showing raw syntax characters:

| Markdown source | Modal rendering |
|---|---|
| `# Heading` / `## Heading` / `### Heading` | yellow accent, `#` markers stripped |
| `` `inline code` `` | cyan, backticks stripped |
| ` ``` …code block… ``` ` | cyan multi-line, fences stripped |
| `- item` / `* item` | `• item` (dim grey bullet + normal text) |
| `**bold**` / `*italic*` | normal text — syntax stripped, no emphasis (no bold font at this size) |
| `[link text](url)` | `link text` only — URL dropped |
| `~~strikethrough~~` | normal text — syntax stripped |

#### DeepSeek key

You'll need a **DeepSeek API key** from
[platform.deepseek.com/api_keys](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys).
The installer prompts for it alongside the OpenRouter key (skippable
— plain voice IME works without it).  Stored at
`~/.config/dssh-whisper/deepseek-key` chmod 0600 — see [Rotating a
key later](#rotating-a-key-later) above to change it.

### Notes

- 3DS firmware caps recording at ~32 s per press (the 1 MB mic buffer
  fills at 16 kHz × 16-bit).  Tap **START** earlier to commit any time.
- Use **HOME** (not START) to exit DSSH — START is dedicated to voice.
- `~/.config/dssh-whisper/` is on `.gitignore` already; rotating the
  API key is one `echo > api-key` away.
- The 3DS code calls `~/.local/bin/dssh-whisper-shim` over a libssh2
  exec channel.  The shim reads the active track and dispatches —
  switching tracks doesn't require restarting the 3DS or the SSH
  session.

### Advanced — Dual track (self-hosted, ⚠️ not recommended)

> ⚠️ **Heads-up**: the self-hosted track loads the `whisper-small`
> model (~1 GB resident) and runs CPU inference for every recording.
> On a 2-vCPU AWS t3.medium with VS Code Remote, claude-code, tmux, and
> chrome-devtools-mcp running, transcribing 4 seconds of audio took
> **~40 seconds** — vs. **~1.5 seconds** through OpenRouter at the same
> moment.  The cost difference is so small ($0.04 per *audio* hour ≈
> pennies/month for personal use) that we strongly recommend the cloud
> path unless you have a hard reason to keep audio on-prem.
>
> If you do go local, plan on:
>
> - **4+ idle vCPU cores** at 3+ GHz — anything less and the 3DS UX
>   spinner becomes painful.
> - **2+ GB free RAM** for the small.zh model + buffers.
> - **No competing CPU consumers** during transcription windows.
> - **~600 MB disk** for the model + venv.

If you genuinely want the offline path, the same `dssh-whisper` CLI
manages both tracks side-by-side — install the dual variant and flip
on demand:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fishason/DSSH.git ~/dssh-repo
bash ~/dssh-repo/tools/install_whisper_dual.sh
```

The dual install still defaults to `track=api`; flip to local only when
needed:

```bash
dssh-whisper switch local   # next START press → self-hosted whisper.cpp
dssh-whisper switch api     # next START press → OpenRouter (default)
dssh-whisper switch         # no arg = toggle
```

## Key bindings

### Physical buttons

| Button | Function | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Enter (EN) / **emit pinyin buffer as English** (IME) | Accidentally typed English in CN mode? Press A and the buffer flies to SSH as raw ASCII — no need to backspace and switch modes. |
| **B** | Backspace / consume one pinyin letter | Hold-style auto-repeat (peaks at 60 / sec) |
| **X** | Alt modifier | Hold-style — held when the next key fires |
| **Y** | Ctrl modifier | Hold-style — Y + tap `c` → Ctrl-C |
| **L** | Shift modifier / **+ Circle Pad → right pane** | See [tmux split scrolling](#tmux-split-scrolling) below |
| **R** | Toggle CN/EN input mode | Top-right ENG/CHN reflects the current mode |
| **SELECT** | Esc | Tap fires immediately |
| **START** | **Voice input toggle** | Press once to start recording; press again to stop and transcribe.  See [Voice input](#voice-input). |
| **Space** (soft keyboard) | Plain space (EN) / **commit highlighted candidate** (IME) | Matches sogou / fcitx convention |
| **Shift + .** | **。** (full-width Chinese period, U+3002) | Works in both EN and CN modes |
| **D-pad ↑↓** | Arrow keys / IME page nav | When the IME buffer is active, ↑↓ paginates candidates |
| **D-pad ←→** | Arrow keys / IME selection cursor | When active, ←→ moves the candidate cursor within the page |
| **Circle Pad ↑↓** | Scrollback / tmux mouse-wheel | Default targets the left/top pane; **hold L → right/bottom pane** |

> Long-press D-pad or B: 250 ms initial delay, ramps up to 12 / sec at
> 0.5 s, peaks at 60 / sec after 1.5 s.

### tmux split scrolling

The 3DS has no real cursor, so tmux's mouse-wheel events get routed by
the `(col, row)` we send.  DSSH defaults to `(1, 1)` → hits the
left/top pane; holding **L** sends `(60, 12)` → hits the right/bottom
pane.  In a vertical-split tmux:

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| Circle Pad ↑↓ | Scrolls the **left** pane |
| L held + Circle Pad ↑↓ | Scrolls the **right** pane |

### Soft keyboard

The bottom screen is the soft keyboard — two pages:

- **Letters page** (default): QWERTY layout with `,` `.` punctuation,
  Tab, and a wide Space.
- **Symbols page** (toggle via the bottom-left `123` key):
  `1234567890`, `!@#$%^&*()` cleanly aligned on two rows, plus other
  common punctuation including `?` and `\`.

Any key supports hold-style modifier combos.  Example:
**hold Y + tap b** = `Ctrl-B` (the tmux prefix).

**SET button** (bottom-right, v1.2): opens/closes the on-device
settings page — server list `< SRV n/4 >` (browsing to a configured
slot activates it), HOST/PORT/USER/PASSWORD/KEY PATH rows (tap to
edit; **A** commit, **B** backspace, **SELECT** cancel; AUTH row taps
toggle key/password), VOICE API field, **SAVE** writes the config back
to the SD card, **RECONNECT** drops the session and re-dials.

**WIN button** (left of SET, v1.3): cycles through the configured
servers.  Background windows stay connected and keep exchanging data
(fish/tmux never stall on pending queries); the first visit to a
window shows an empty terminal plus a "SELECT to connect" hint instead
of silently starting a multi-second handshake — press **SELECT** to
dial.  The WIN label shows the active window (`2/3`); it renders dimmed
with a single configured server.

### Status bar (top 30 px)

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [SFT]   candidate strip / pinyin buffer / cands [CHN]│
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Left slot [STA]**: 3-letter modifier indicator (SFT/CTL/ALT stays lit
  while held; ENT/BSP/ESC/`R→C` flashes for 200 ms on transient events).
- **Middle**: pinyin buffer + candidates in CN mode; empty in EN mode.
- **Right slot [ENG/CHN]**: current IME mode.  **Double-tap to enter
  the debug page**.

## Using the IME

### Full pinyin

Tapping letters in CN mode brings up the candidate strip:

```
ni       → 年 你 牛奶 娘 念   (page 1/52, total 256)
nihao    → 你好 你好吗 你好啊 拟好 你好呀
shijie   → 世界 世界上 世界杯 世界各地 世界里
```

- **A** or **Space** commits the currently highlighted candidate.
- **D-pad ←→** moves the highlight within the current page.
- **D-pad ↑↓** flips between pages.
- **Tap** a candidate to commit it directly.
- **B** consumes one letter from the pinyin buffer.

### Abbreviation (initials)

Every multi-syllable word gets an extra entry keyed by its initials —
typing the initials still surfaces it (with weight × 0.3, so the
full-pinyin form still ranks first when typed in full):

```
nh → 你好  (around the 8th candidate)
wm → 我们  (top candidate)
sj → 世界
zw → 中文
xx → 谢谢
```

Page or cursor over to your target, then commit with A.

### Prefix fallback

Typed an extra letter past a valid prefix?  The engine automatically
matches the longest valid prefix and shows the surplus letters in red:

```
buffer:  niha[oz]    ← niha in green + oz in red
candidates:           still showing what nihao would produce
```

Press B to chew the red tail back to a clean prefix.

### Modifiers always bypass the IME

In CN mode, **hold Y + tap c** still sends `Ctrl-C`; **hold L + tap a**
still sends `A`.  Modifiers take priority over IME routing, so
vim / tmux / claude-code shortcuts keep working.

### Bail out: emit pinyin as English

CN mode + non-empty buffer + press **A** = the buffer flies to SSH as
raw ASCII letters and clears.  Example: you accidentally typed
`cd /etc` while in CN mode and the candidate strip is showing strange
Chinese.  One press of **A** delivers `cd /etc` to the shell — no
backspacing, no mode-toggle, no retyping.

> Difference: **Space** commits the highlighted candidate (Chinese
> chars on screen).  **A** sends the typed letters as-is.

---

## Debug page

**Double-tap the ENG/CHN badge** in the top-right corner (two taps within
500 ms) to enter the debug overlay.  Single-tap the badge again to leave.

What it shows:

- Title + exit hint.
- **recv hex**: the last 32 bytes received from SSH — for diagnosing
  ANSI / SCS / mouse-protocol issues at the byte level.
- **Physical key cheat sheet**: a condensed version of the bindings
  table above.
- **MASCOT: ON/OFF** toggle button.  Default is ON.

## Build from source

### Prerequisites

- Linux x86\_64 (tested on Ubuntu 22.04; other distros need the obvious
  package-name adjustments).
- [devkitPro / devkitARM](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
  release 65+, GCC 14.2.0.
- Python 3.10+ with Pillow (for font + dictionary generators).

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Install devkitPro
wget https://apt.devkitpro.org/install-devkitpro-pacman
bash install-devkitpro-pacman
sudo dkp-pacman -S 3ds-dev 3ds-mbedtls 3ds-libpng 3ds-zlib

# 2. Clone recursively so libts3ds and its private lwIP are checked out
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Fishason/DSSH.git
cd DSSH

# Existing non-recursive clone only:
git submodule update --init --recursive

# 3. Cross-compile libssh2 (one-time, drops into $DEVKITPRO/portlibs/3ds/lib/)
bash build-libssh2.sh

# 4. Install system fonts (Terminus provides ASCII / box-drawing)
sudo apt install fonts-terminus

# 5. Fetch font sources (Zpix)
bash tools/fetch_fonts.sh

# 6. Generate the font atlas (→ source/font_data.c, ~3 MB)
python3 tools/gen_font.py

# 7. Fetch + build the pinyin dictionary (→ romfs/pinyin_dict.bin, ~13 MB)
bash tools/fetch_pinyin_dict.sh
python3 tools/gen_pinyin_dict.py

# 8. Build the .3dsx (optional: bake a LAN STT endpoint in as the
#    default voice backend — injected at compile time, not stored in
#    the repo)
make DSSH_VOICE_API_DEFAULT=https://your-server:29006/api/stt

# 9. (Optional) build the .cia
bash tools/install_cia_tools.sh   # installs bannertool + makerom into ~/bin
make cia                          # → DSSH.cia
```

The build command itself is unchanged: `make` first builds the pinned
`libts3ds/build/3ds/libts3ds.a`, then links DSSH. If the submodule is missing,
the Makefile prints the initialization command instead of failing later with a
missing directory or header.

### Test the IME engine on the host (no 3DS needed)

```bash
make test-ime
```

Compiles `tools/test_ime.c` linked against `source/ime_pinyin.c` and
runs nine smoke-test queries (`ni → 你`, `nihao → 你好`, `nh → 你好`,
etc.).

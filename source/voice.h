/* Voice-input subsystem.  Records 16 kHz PCM16 mono via the 3DS mic into
 * an aligned heap buffer, then streams the bytes over an auxiliary
 * libssh2 channel to `dssh-whisper-shim` on the server side, reads back
 * the transcribed Chinese UTF-8 text, and forwards it to the main SSH
 * shell channel as if the user had typed it.
 *
 * State machine, driven by physical KEY_START presses:
 *   IDLE   ──► RECORDING  (mic init + start sampling)
 *   RECORDING ──► TRANSCRIBING (stop mic, open aux channel, exec shim)
 *   TRANSCRIBING ──► IDLE (response received, text forwarded to ssh_write)
 *   ANY ──► ERROR ──► IDLE (auto-decay after ~2 s)
 *
 * Recording auto-stops after ~7 s (frame counter) before the 8 s mic
 * buffer overruns; user can also press START a second time to end
 * recording at any point.
